The files that are uploaded into the repository are the shapes like circle, square, person, Triangle and canvas. I believe they are the only files that are visible because github cant do anything with the extra information the other files provide.
to achieve movement in the terminal, i need to repeatedly input the command to move the figures up or down. another way to make this happen is by using a different command like move horizontal and verticle.
setting black and white makes the color pallete of all objects black and white.
